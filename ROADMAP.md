# FerroLink – Project Roadmap

*Last updated: $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')*

---
## 🎯 High-level Goals
1. Production-grade secure remote-desktop / monitoring stack in Rust.
2. First-class observability (Prometheus + Grafana + structured logs).
3. Simple, reproducible deployment (Docker Compose → K8s).

---
## ✅ Completed
- Latency benchmark script (`bench/latency.sh`) + sample results
- Minimal Grafana dashboard (`grafana/agent-overview.json`)
- Prometheus alert rule example (`grafana/alerts.yml`)
- Startup guide (`startup.md`)
